<p>But instead of generating a model directly (which we'll
be doing later), let's set up a scaffold. A scaffold in
Rails is a full set of model, database migration for that
model, controller to manipulate it, views to view and
manipulate the data, and a test suite for each of the
above.</p>

<p>We will set up a simple resource called
"HighScore" that will keep track of our highest score on
video games we play.</p>
